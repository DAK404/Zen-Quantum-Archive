Here we talk about the general stuff to refer to while building the program.

1) clearing the console.

for Windows:

new ProcessBuilder("cmd", "/c", "cls").inheritIO().start().waitFor();

for Unix and Unix like systems only
System.out.print("\033[H\033[2J");
System.out.flush();

Explanation:
the 1st code is windows exclusive which uses unicode.
the 2nd code is for ANSI based terminals.
